    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Use <a href="github.com">Github</a> to source control your Xcode project is really cool and rather convenient. Many of you may have tried to upload or link your current Xcode project to Github, but found it’s annoying because you always got some slight problems that stopped you from reaching there.</p>

<p>Here, i’d like to tell you a really simple way to quickly upload  your current project, or a new project, to Github and start to source control it immediately.</p>

<p>Few things that should be prepared before start:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Github account</li>
<li>Github app for Mac, <a href="https://mac.github.com">download</a> the latest version.</li>
<li>A Xcode project that you’d like to push onto Github</li>
</ul>


<p>Okay, now if you’re ready, let’s start.</p>

<h2>Step 1, Create a new repository where you wanna push your project to.</h2>

<p>Here i’ve create a new repo called <strong>MyXcodeProject</strong>
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wqlezx8mv34t2xn/Create%20Project%20on%20Github.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once it has been successfully created, you shall see your new repo like this

<h2>Step 2, Open <a href="https://mac.github.com">Github for Mac</a> Client, find and download the project that you just create.</h2>

<p>Open the Client, select <code>File -&gt; New Repository</code>  or simply press <code>command + N</code>, find the project that we just created under  <strong>Clone</strong> tap.

<p>Press the <strong>Clone MyXcodeProject</strong> button, choose whatever directory that you want to put this project, <strong>/Desktop</strong> for example. Once it’s successfully cloned, you shall see something like this.

<h2>Step 3, Move your own project into the <strong>MyXcodeProject</strong> folder that you just cloned.</h2>

<p>At this stage, you should have an almost empty folder that you just cloned from the Github server.

<p>Also, you need to have your own project that you want to push onto github. It could be any projects, either a new project or a old project that you’ve been developed for years.</p>

<p>I just created a new project called <strong>MyXcodeProjectDemo</strong>, and i want it managed by Github under source control.
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/iw7mwucuz08sscb/your%20own%20project.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, move all files and folders under your <strong>MyXcodeProjectDemo</strong> project into the previous cloned folder, like this.

<h2>Step 4, In the Github for Mac client, commit all changes that you’ve just made.</h2>

<p>Open up you Github client for Mac, click on the <strong>MyXcodeProject</strong> tab on the very left side. You could see quit a lot changes here, Woooooo.

<p>Press the Commit&amp;Sync button. Once it’s be been successfully committed and synced, open <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> page, find the corresponding  repository page, you should see the whole project should have been uploaded.
Before you go to the next step, please <strong>copy the link of your repo</strong>, you can do this by clicking the place where my arrow pointing to in the image.</p>

<h2>Step 5, Open Xcode, check out the project from your Github repo</h2>

<p>Close Github client for Mac, delete all the files and folders you created before, including <strong>MyXcodeProject</strong> and <strong>MyXcodeProjectDemo</strong>. Yes, you don’t need them any more, it’s all being managed by Github already!</p>

<p>Open the Xcode application, select <code>Check out an existing project</code>.
In the next page, you’ll be able to select on a repo to check out, or in this case, you should <strong>paste</strong> the link of your repo into the textfield.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/848mc6fu1r6lwmi/check%20out.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Select a proper location that you’d like to put your project for  long term.</p>

<h2><strong>Once it’s finished, you’ll have the project ready for you to develop with source control by Github enabled. Try to make your first modification on the source code, then commit&amp;push it to Github &ndash; <em>in Xcode select <code>Source Control -&gt; commit</code> or press <code>shift + command + C</code>, and make sure you’ve checked the <code>push to remote</code> in the following window </em></strong>.</h2>
